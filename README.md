##Things I had to do to JS File
***FIRST***
*moved working btn up to top so it starts once its pressed since JS reads*
*from top to bottom*
***SECOND***
*Made a function to prompt how many characters were to be used*
*made sure it followed guidelines and to add a **return** function if wrong amount was given*
***THIRD***
*began listing confirm commands to prompt ser what elements they wanted in password*
***FOURTH***
*made an **Array** of each letter upper/lower and symbols/numbers while also making "password" a empty string*
***FIFTH***
*Making **IF** statements with a **Math.floor** equation to randomize the output for user*
***SIXTH***
*Finally using a **getelementbyID** function to call back those responses to generate onto HTML page with **innerhtml** onto the btn*
